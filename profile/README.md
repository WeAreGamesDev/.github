# We are Games

We are Games is a small indie development team which mainly focuses on creating games of the horror genre. The creation currently being maintained and developed is [**Long Lucas' SCARY TREEHOUSE**](https://wearegamesdev.itch.io/long-lucas), which is "an early 2000â€™s/flash game-inspired retro comedy horror with the goal of getting enough fuel (and your car keys) to then drive away from Long Lucas' treehouse."

To keep up with the development team, there are social links attached to the organization which will lead you to other We are Games accounts.
